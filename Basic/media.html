     <!-- When we include the attribute "loading=lazy" in an image tag, it tells the browser to delay the 
    loading of the image until it is about to come into the user's viewport, or until the user starts 
    scrolling towards it. This means that images located further down the page or outside the initial viewport
    are not loaded immediately when the page loads. Instead, they are loaded dynamically as the user scrolls
    or interacts with the page.
    On small projects we can't see any difference in loading time but in large webpages where ton of data
    is preset will have surely reduced  initial loading time after using loading=lazy
